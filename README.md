### Tobii Eyetracking Utility Functions

> An R package for pre-processing raw eye-tracking data around *Tobii's I-VT Fixation Filter*

----

## Installation

`devtools::install_github(ccp-eva/eyewit)`

## Whatâ€™s Happening

### eyewit Roadmap
#### Release 0.5
Progress is tracked here: https://github.com/ccp-eva/eyewit/projects/4
Now that eyewit is an actual R package, I need to address the following points:
- [ ] Allmost all functions need proper documentation
- [ ] Many functions need unit tests
- [ ] Refactor functions (espacially `get_looks`)

#### Release 0.6
Progress is tracked here: https://github.com/ccp-eva/eyewit/projects/8

### January 2022
- [x] Successfully converted to an R package (`devtools::install_github(ccp-eva/eyewit)`)


## Functions

As of January 2022, functions are being refactored and documented in their corresponding helper files. This table will is out of date and will be removed!

| preflight()               | Takes a `df` and the `interface` as input and performs several checks (check for required columns, fix column names, check that rownames are in an incremental order (i.e., no missing rows or prior pre-processing), check if single AOIs are not overlapping |
| get_startend_pos()        | Returns a list of start and end positions for a given `df` and a `regex` pattern. Those position pairs define usually a trial                                                                                                                                  |
