# `eyewit`
### Tobii Eyetracking Utility Functions

> Helper functions for common eye-tracking data wrangling tasks and eye-tracking analysis around _Tobiiâ€™s I-VT Fixation Filter_

## Development

### Road to Package `eyewit`

As of now this repo is a collection of R functions. Release 1.0.0 aims to put all these into a library (`eyewit::`).

**Project Progress Tracker:** https://github.com/ccp-eva/eyewit/projects/4

### Road to Unit Tests

Modification in delicate functions (e.g., calculating looking time) may result in wrong calculations. Thus, an automatic unit test must be performed to grant correct calculations. This will be the next milestone after 1.0.0.

### Road to Shiny

When this package reached a mature state, I will transfer functionality in a web UI.

## Functions
